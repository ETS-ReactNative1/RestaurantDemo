# RestaurantDemo [React Native]
I've built small restaurant demo app in React Native. In this app, I've used Yelp API to fetch data from server using React Native `axios` library and showing into to the list as per following UI.



**Install React Navigation**

```shell
npm install react-navigation
```



**Install Dependencies**


```shell
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```



**Install React Navigation Stack**

```shell
npm install react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view
```



**Install axios using following command:**

```shell
npm install axios
```



Start the app and clear cache with `expo r -c`



## How to Run?

Download the application from github and navigate to the folder then, run following command:

```shell
npm start
```



**To run on iOS Simulator:**

```shell
npm run ios
```



**To run on Android emulator:**

```shell
npm run android
```



## Fetures:

* React Navigation / React Navigation Stack
* Default Listing of Restaurants
* Search Restaurants
* Navigate to Detail Screen, to view more images from the Restaurants
* Error Handling
